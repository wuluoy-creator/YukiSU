**English** | [简体中文](./zh/README.md) | [日本語](./ja/README.md) | [Türkçe](./tr/README.md) | [Русский](./ru/README.md)

A kernel-based root solution for Android devices, forked from [`SukiSU-Ultra`](https://github.com/ShirkNeko/SukiSU-Ultra), with some useless parts removed and some interesting changes added.

> **⚠️ Important Notice**
>
> YukiSU userspace has been **completely rewritten in C++** (previously based on Rust). This means that YukiSU may behave differently from other KernelSU forks. If you encounter any issues, please report them to us rather than to upstream projects.

## Features

1. Kernel-based `su` and root permission management
2. Support for external MetaModule lifecycle and script integration, allowing users to choose the module mounting backend themselves
3. [App Profile](https://kernelsu.org/zh_CN/guide/app-profile.html) and per-app non-root configuration
4. Dynamic manager support, allowing trusted managers outside the built-in package name/signature path to be configured
5. APatch-style SuperKey authentication, supporting both compile-time keys and keys injected into the LKM by `ksud`
6. ADB root, sulog, SELinux hide, module `init.rc` injection, and other upstream features
7. Built-in YukiZygisk, a kernel-based Zygisk implementation, fully compatible with [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) modules
8. TSR-based sucompat/syscall hook infrastructure
9. UTS view functionality, supporting `uname` spoofing by modifying `uts_ns` without rebuilding the kernel
10. More features for you to discover...

## Compatibility Status

- YukiSU currently supports only loadable kernel modules (`CONFIG_KSU=m`) and no longer supports built-in `CONFIG_KSU=y`.
- YukiSU supports LKM mode on Android GKI 2.0 devices (kernel 5.10+). GKI 1.0 kernels and non-GKI kernels are not supported.
- YukiSU supports only `arm64-v8a` devices.
- YukiZygisk supports building and injection for both the `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a` ABIs.
